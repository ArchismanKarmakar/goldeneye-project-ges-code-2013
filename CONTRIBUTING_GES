Thanks for your interest in the GoldenEye: Source project (GES).  When you make a
contribution to the project (e.g. create an Issue or submit a Pull Request)
(a "Contribution"), we want to be able to use your Contribution to improve
our mod. 

In order to contribute you must accept and comply with the requirements outlined 
in the GNU GPL v3 license located in LICENSE_GES.

GES is happy to accept pull requests and issues into our repository in these cases:
 * Changes that fix bugs in the SDK and the Mod itself. The repository
   should build out of the box. A pull request will be denied if it does not.
 * Functional fixes that make the code more efficient, easier to read, and/or
   corrects logic errors.

If you are going to make a pull request, please keep them as granular as
possible. Pull requests with 3-4 unrelated changes in them aren't going to
be accepted.
